# DES
use DES to encrypt a text

You should input the text and the key.

You can also choose how many times the programme encrypt the text.

This programme is just a 0.1 version, and I'm not responsible for the programme’s correctness.

Example:

Input the text:DES on GitHub
Input the key:12345678
Input how many time you want to encrypt the text:16
The Cipher is: 10110011111000111110001000000110111111101101001000011110011110001100110001010010000000100100101110011010111001001000101000100101

I will upgrade the arithmetic in one week, and you are welcomed to tell me the BUG you find in my programme！
